# Samples As Templates

In a node project is common to have a folder structure where files follow some naming convention, to avoid copying and pasting on the folder's name and files you could type `sat` to use samples as templates

    $ npm install @marvinc.silva/sat -D

## Commands

## WIP

    sat use [sample] [location] [name]

### Planned

    sat list
    sat use [sample] [location] [name] <arguments>
    sat create [sample]
    sat delete [sample]
